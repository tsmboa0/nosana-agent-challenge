# Solvestor ü§ñ

## Introduction

**The crypto world is buzzing about trading stocks directly with crypto on Solana. But while everyone wants in, only a few truly know how to analyze stocks and trade them smartly.**

That‚Äôs why we built **Solvestor**: an AI-powered Telegram bot that not only analyzes stocks and tokens to spot the best moments to buy or sell, but can also execute trades for you‚Äîall through a simple text or voice command. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned trader or just crypto-curious, Solvestor brings powerful, automated investing to your fingertips.

## Agent System Deep Dive

Solvestor‚Äôs intelligence comes from a team of specialized agents, each with a unique role. These agents work as a team, combining their strengths to deliver smart, actionable investment decisions and seamless execution.

```

## Agent Details & Their Tools

Each agent in Solvestor is powered by a set of specialized tools, making them experts in their domain. Here‚Äôs how they work under the hood:

### üß† Fundamental Analyst
- **Purpose:**
  - Analyzes news, fundamentals, and on-chain data to provide deep insights into stocks and tokens.
- **Tools Used:**
  - **Web Search Tool:** Leverages the Tavily Search API to gather the latest news and fundamental data from across the web.

### üìà Technical Analyst
- **Purpose:**
  - Examines price charts, technical indicators, and historical data to spot trends and trading signals.
- **Tools Used:**
  - **Technical Tools:** Computes indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, SMA) and analyzes chart patterns.
  - **Chart Service:** Generates candlestick charts for visual analysis.
  - **Web Search Tool:** Can supplement analysis with technical news or sentiment.

### ü§ñ Main Agent (Trader)
- **Purpose:**
  - Acts as the conductor, orchestrating all other agents and tools to deliver a seamless trading experience.
  - Makes the final decision on whether to buy, sell, or hold.
- **Tools Used:**
  - **Workflow-as-Tool:** Invokes both analysis and execution workflows as needed.
  - **Execution Tools:** Handles trade execution, quoting, and transaction management.

### üé§ Voice Agent
- **Purpose:**
  - Enables hands-free interaction by processing and transcribing voice commands from users.
- **Tools Used:**
  - **Voice Processing Tool:** Converts speech to text and routes requests to the appropriate agent.
  - **Telegram Tools:** Sends and receives voice messages via the Telegram Bot.

## Workflows Overview

Solvestor‚Äôs power comes from orchestrating complex tasks through modular workflows. These workflows coordinate agents and tools to deliver seamless analysis and trading.

### üß© Analysis Workflow

The analysis workflow brings together the Fundamental and Technical Analyst agents to provide a comprehensive market view. Both agents work in parallel steps, combining their insights for smarter decisions.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start(["Start Analysis Workflow"])
    Start --> F["Fundamental Analyst"]
    Start --> T["Technical Analyst"]
    F --> Merge["Merge Insights"]
    T --> Merge
    Merge --> End(["Return Combined Analysis"])
```

- **Parallel Processing:** Fundamental and Technical analysis run simultaneously for speed and depth.
- **Merged Insights:** Results are combined and sent to the main agent for action.

### ‚ö° Execution Workflow

The execution workflow manages the process of trading, including a unique suspend-resume/ Human-in-the-loop mechanism for human intervention (e.g., entering a passcode before executing a trade).

```mermaid
graph TD
    Start(["Start Execution Workflow"])
    Start --> Q["Get Trade Quote"]
    Q --> S["Suspend & Request Passcode"]
    S --> Resume["Resume on Passcode Entry"]
    Resume --> E["Execute Trade"]
    E --> End(["Return Trade Result"])
```

- **Suspend-Resume:** Pauses for user input (passcode) before executing sensitive actions.
- **Secure Execution:** Ensures only authorized trades are performed.

## Workflow-as-a-Tool: Modular Intelligence

One of Solvestor‚Äôs most powerful design patterns is **Workflow-as-a-Tool**. This means that entire workflows‚Äîlike analysis or trade execution‚Äîare packaged as modular tools that any agent (especially the main agent) can invoke as needed.

**How it works:**
- Workflows are exposed as callable tools, just like APIs or utility functions.
- The main agent (Trader) can trigger these workflows dynamically, chaining together complex actions (e.g., analyze ‚Üí decide ‚Üí execute) in a flexible, agentic way.
- This makes the system highly modular, extensible, and easy to maintain or expand.

**Benefits:**
- **Modularity:** New workflows or tools can be added without disrupting existing logic.
- **Reusability:** Agents can reuse workflows as building blocks for more complex strategies.
- **Orchestration:** The main agent can coordinate multiple workflows and tools, adapting to user needs in real time.

## Security, Encryption & Rate Limiting

Solvestor is built with security and user protection at its core. Here‚Äôs how we keep your data and assets safe:

### üîí Encryption & Secure Storage
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption:** All private keys and sensitive data are encrypted using industry-standard AES-256-GCM.
- **Strong Secrets:** The encryption secret must be exactly 32 characters, ensuring robust protection.
- **No Exposure:** Private keys are never logged, exposed, or transmitted insecurely.
- **Database Security:** All sensitive information is stored encrypted in the database.

### üõ°Ô∏è Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention
- **Per-User Rate Limiting:** Prevents spam and abuse by limiting how frequently users can interact with the bot.
- **Context-Aware Controls:** Rate limits are enforced on both commands and API calls, keeping the system responsive and fair for everyone.

### üëÆ Human-in-the-Loop for Sensitive Actions
- **Suspend-Resume Mechanism:** For critical actions (like executing trades), the workflow pauses to request a passcode or confirmation from the user, ensuring only authorized actions are performed.
